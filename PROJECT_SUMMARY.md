# WHS Bowling Site - Project Summary

## Executive Summary

The Willard High School Tigers Bowling Team website is a complete, production-ready, world-class web application built to showcase the bowling program, manage team operations, and provide seamless integration with the bowling statistics tracking application.

## Project Specifications Met

### ✅ 1. GCP Infrastructure Enforcement
- Infrastructure configuration defined in `infrastructure.json`
- Firebase services: Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Hosting
- GCP region: us-central1
- Security rules enforced at infrastructure level
- FERPA and COPPA compliance built-in

### ✅ 2. Configurable Branding

- Typography: Montserrat (display), Inter (body)
- School motto: "Focused. Connected. Driven."
- Tiger mascot imagery integration-ready
- All branding centralized in `src/config/branding.ts`

### ✅ 3. Role-Based Access Control

**Three distinct user roles:**

**Public (Unauthenticated)**
- View all public pages (Home, About, Roster, Schedule, Stats, Contact)
- Submit contact form inquiries
- No login required
- Access to public team information

**Player (Authenticated - Role: player)**
- All public access
- Personal dashboard
- Edit own profile (name, grade, graduation year, bio)
- Upload/manage profile photo (5MB limit)
- View personal statistics
- Direct access to Stats app
- Cannot access coach features

**Coach/Admin (Authenticated - Role: coach)**

- Access all player data
- Contact form submission management

### ✅ 4. Stats App Integration

**Safe Integration Strategy (No Stats App Modifications)**

Three integration options documented in `STATS_APP_INTEGRATION.md`:

1. **Shared Firebase Project (Recommended)**
   - Both apps use same Firebase project
   - Stats app writes data, WHS Site reads (read-only)
   - Shared collections: players, games, sessions, frames
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - Single authentication system
   - No modifications to Stats app code

2. **External Service**
   - Completely separate Firebase projects
   - Link to Stats app via URL
   - Pass authentication tokens
   - Independent deployments

3. **Read-Only Data Sync**
   - Cloud Functions sync data
   - One-way sync from Stats app to WHS Site
   - Summary data only

**Current Implementation:**
- WHS Site displays team stats (averages, high games, games played)
- Links to Stats app for detailed analytics
- Security rules allow read-only access to Stats app collections
- Environment variable for Stats app URL configuration
