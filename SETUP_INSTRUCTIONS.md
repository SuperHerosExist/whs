## Step 4: Import Player Data from Stats App (5 minutes)

### Option A: Using Firebase Console (Manual - Recommended for first time)

1. Go to your **Stats app Firebase project**:
   (You mentioned you have ~14 players in Stats)

2. Open the **Firestore Database** in that project

3. Find your **players collection**

4. For each player, note:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Grade level
   - Average score
   - High game
   - Games played

5. Go back to **WHS Firestore** and create each player manually:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/willard-tigers-bowling/firestore/databases/-default-/data

6. Click on `players` collection (or create it)

7. For each player, click "+ Add document":

   **Auto-ID** (let Firebase generate)

   | Field | Type | Value |
   |-------|------|-------|
   | uid | string | (will be filled when player signs in) |
   | name | string | Player's full name |
   | email | string | Player's email |
   | grade | string | `9`, `10`, `11`, or `12` |
   | programId | string | `willard-tigers` |
   | averageScore | number | e.g., `205` |
   | highGame | number | e.g., `278` |
   | gamesPlayed | number | e.g., `24` |
   | isActive | boolean | `true` |
   | bio | string | `Member of Willard Tigers Bowling Team` |
   | photoURL | string | `null` or empty |
   | createdAt | timestamp | Set to now |
   | updatedAt | timestamp | Set to now |

### Option B: Using Firebase Admin SDK (Automated - Advanced)

If you want to automate this, I can create a script that:
1. Reads from Stats app Firebase
2. Imports into WHS Firebase
3. Matches players by email/name

Let me know if you want Option B and I'll create it!

## Step 5: Test Everything (3 minutes)

1. **Sign Out** from https://willard-tigers-bowling.web.app

2. **Sign In** again with Google (davesfx@gmail.com)

   - Roster management
   - Team statistics
   - Add player button

5. Click **"Roster"** in navigation - you should see:
   - All 14 players with their stats

- Players can edit their bios

### 3. Content Management
- Add team announcements
- Upload team photos

## Need Help?

**If something doesn't work:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify Firestore security rules are deployed
3. Make sure `role: "coach"` is exactly spelled in your user document
4. Ensure programId is `willard-tigers` (lowercase, hyphenated)

**If you want me to automate player import:**
Just say "automate player import" and I'll create a script that pulls from your Stats app Firebase!
