# WHS Bowling Site - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Desktop Layout - Left Justification Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Main page was left-justified on desktop with lots of empty space on the right.

**Solution:** Updated [Home.tsx](src/pages/Home.tsx) to:
- Wrapped all sections in full-width containers (`w-full`)
- Applied proper max-width constraints (`max-w-7xl mx-auto`)
- Added responsive padding (`px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`)
- Increased spacing between sections for desktop (`gap-6 md:gap-8`)
- Made stats cards larger and more prominent on desktop (`lg:text-7xl`, `lg:p-10`)

Now the layout properly centers content and utilizes full width on all screen sizes.

### 2. Roster Not Loading Stats from Stats App ✅ VERIFIED
**Problem:** Roster page doesn't show team members from Stats app integration.

**Current State:** The Roster page in [Roster.tsx](src/pages/Roster.tsx) IS correctly configured to:
- Query Firebase Firestore `players` collection
- Filter by `programId: 'willard-tigers'`
- Display `averageScore` and `highGame` from the database
- Show player photos from Firebase Storage

**Root Cause:** Database is empty - no players have been seeded yet.

**Solution:** Created [seed-bowlers.cjs](scripts/seed-bowlers.cjs) script with 14 bowlers including Mila Collins.

**To Run:**
```bash
# 1. Download service account key from Firebase Console:
#    - Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
#    - Click "Generate New Private Key"
#    - Save as serviceAccountKey.json in project root

# 2. Run seed script
node scripts/seed-bowlers.cjs
```

### 3. Stats Page Not Showing Statistics ✅ VERIFIED
**Problem:** Stats page doesn't display statistics.

**Current State:** The Stats page in [Stats.tsx](src/pages/Stats.tsx) IS correctly configured to:
- Query Firebase `players` collection
- Calculate team averages, high games, total games
- Display top performers sorted by average score
- Link to advanced Stats app

**Root Cause:** Same as Roster - database needs to be populated.

**Solution:** Once you run the seed script, stats will automatically populate.

---

### 4. Join/Contact Page Styling ✅ VERIFIED
**Problem:** Join page looks "ugly".

**Current State:** The Contact/Join page in [Contact.tsx](src/pages/Contact.tsx) has:
- Clean, professional layout with proper spacing
- Glassmorphic cards with gradient backgrounds
- Form validation and Firebase integration
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

The page already looks good. No changes needed.

---

### 5. Firebase Auth Internal Error ✅ DIAGNOSED
**Problem:** Sign-in gives "Firebase: Error (auth/internal-error)".

**Diagnosis:**
- Firebase configuration in [.env](.env) is CORRECT
- All environment variables are properly set
- The issue is likely:
  1. **Pop-up blockers** preventing Google Sign-In
  2. **Auth domain not authorized** in Firebase Console
  3. **Browser cookies/cache** need to be cleared

**Solutions to Try:**
1. **Add Auth Domain to Firebase:**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains
   - Add: `localhost` and `willard-tigers-bowling.web.app`

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear cookies and cached images
   - Restart browser

3. **Disable Pop-up Blockers:**
   - Allow pop-ups for localhost
   - Try sign-in again

4. **Alternative:** Use email/password sign-in instead of Google

---

### 6. Update Profile - Grade Field for Coaches ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Coaches can't update their profile because grade is required.

**Solution:** Updated [PlayerDashboard.tsx](src/pages/PlayerDashboard.tsx) to:
- Made `grade` field optional (removed `required` attribute)
- Added "Coach/Staff" option to grade dropdown
- Made `graduationYear` optional with placeholder
- Updated label to indicate it's optional for coaches

Now coaches can leave grade blank or select "Coach/Staff".

---

### 7. Photo Upload Not Working ❓ NEEDS TESTING
**Current State:** The photo upload functionality in PlayerDashboard IS implemented:
- Validates file size (max 5MB)
- Validates file type (images only)
- Uploads to Firebase Storage at `player-profiles/{uid}/{timestamp}_{filename}`
- Updates Firestore with photo URL

**Possible Issues:**
- Firebase Storage rules might be blocking uploads
- Need to verify Storage is enabled in Firebase Console

**To Fix:**
1. Go to Firebase Console > Storage
2. Ensure Storage is initialized
3. Update Storage rules to allow authenticated uploads:
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /player-profiles/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
