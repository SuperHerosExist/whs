2. Upgrade to Blaze plan (required for production)
3. Enable Authentication (Email/Password + Google)
4. Create Firestore database (us-central1)
5. Enable Cloud Storage
6. Get Firebase configuration
7. **Update `.env` file with real values**

### Step 2: Initialize Firebase CLI (2 minutes)

```bash
cd c:\Users\daves\GCP-INFRA-BASE\gcp-mvps\WHS

# Login (if not already)
firebase login

# Select your project
firebase use --add
```

### Step 3: Deploy Security Rules (1 minute)

```bash
# Deploy Firestore and Storage rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage:rules
```

**CRITICAL**: Deploy rules BEFORE deploying the app!

### Step 4: Deploy Application (2 minutes)

```bash
# Already built! Just deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Your site will be live at: `https://your-project.web.app`

### Step 5: Create First Coach Account (3 minutes)

See QUICKSTART.md Section "Step 8: Create First Coach Account"

1. Sign up via the website
2. Update role to "coach" in Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
