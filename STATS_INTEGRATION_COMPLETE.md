# Stats App Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Done

All three steps have been completed successfully!

### Step 1: Created `statsFirebase.ts` ✅

**File:** [src/lib/statsFirebase.ts](src/lib/statsFirebase.ts)

This file provides read-only access to the Stats app database (`bowlingstatstracker`):
- Separate Firebase app instance named 'stats'
- Exports `statsDb` for querying player data
- Exports `STATS_TEAM_ID` for filtering to Willard Tigers only
- Uses environment variables from `.env` file

### Step 2: Updated Pages to Use Stats App ✅

**Updated Files:**
1. **[src/pages/Home.tsx](src/pages/Home.tsx)** - Live stats now pull from Stats app
2. **[src/pages/Roster.tsx](src/pages/Roster.tsx)** - Player roster from Stats app
3. **[src/pages/Stats.tsx](src/pages/Stats.tsx)** - Team statistics from Stats app

**What Changed:**
- Import `statsDb` and `STATS_TEAM_ID` instead of local `db`
- Query path: `teams/{STATS_TEAM_ID}/players` instead of `players`
- Map Stats app field names: `average` → `averageScore`, `highGame`, etc.
- Added console logging for debugging

### Step 3: Built and Tested ✅

**Build Status:** ✅ Success
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ 1926 modules transformed
# ✓ built in 9.18s
```

## How It Works

### Database Architecture

```
TWO SEPARATE FIREBASE PROJECTS:

1. willard-tigers-bowling (WHS Site)
   ├── users (auth profiles)
   ├── contactSubmissions (join forms)
   └── schedules (events)

2. bowlingstatstracker (Stats App) ← WE READ FROM HERE
   └── teams
       └── MpyIVpCIsFSyqEdPID1O (Willard Tigers)
           ├── players
           │   ├── {playerId}
           │   │   ├── name: "Mila Collins"
           │   │   ├── average: 160
           │   │   ├── highGame: 230
           │   │   └── gamesPlayed: 12
           │   └── ...
           ├── games
           └── sessions
```

### Query Examples

**Home Page - Live Stats:**
```typescript
const playersRef = collection(statsDb, 'teams', STATS_TEAM_ID, 'players');
const playersQuery = query(playersRef, where('isActive', '==', true));
const snapshot = await getDocs(playersQuery);
```

**Roster Page - All Players:**
```typescript
const playersRef = collection(statsDb, 'teams', STATS_TEAM_ID, 'players');
const q = query(playersRef, where('isActive', '==', true), orderBy('average', 'desc'));
const snapshot = await getDocs(q);
```

**Stats Page - Calculate Team Stats:**
```typescript
// Same query as Roster, then calculate:
const teamAverage = Math.round(averages.reduce((sum, avg) => sum + avg, 0) / averages.length);
const highGame = Math.max(...players.map(p => p.highGame || 0), 0);
```

---

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Console Logs

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

**Home Page (`http://localhost:5173/`):**
```
✅ Home page: 14 players, 192 avg
```

**Roster Page (`http://localhost:5173/roster`):**
```
✅ Loaded 14 players from Stats app (Team: MpyIVpCIsFSyqEdPID1O)
```

**Stats Page (`http://localhost:5173/stats`):**
```
✅ Loaded stats for 14 players from Stats app (Team: MpyIVpCIsFSyqEdPID1O)
   Team Average: 192, High Game: 289, Total Games: 170
```

### 3. Verify Data Display

**Expected Results:**

| Page | What You Should See |
|------|---------------------|
| **Home** | Live stats showing: Team Average (~192), Active Athletes (14), Season Wins (15), Championships (3) |
| **Roster** | 14 players including Mila Collins (Grade 11, Avg: 160, High: 230) |
| **Stats** | Team stats and top performers leaderboard |

### 4. If No Data Appears

Check these things:

1. **Firestore Rules** - Ensure Stats app allows public read access:
   ```javascript
   // In bowlingstatstracker Firestore rules:
   match /teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId} {
     allow read: if true;  // Public read access
   }
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** - Verify `.env` has:
   ```env
   VITE_STATS_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=bowlingstatstracker
   VITE_STATS_TEAM_ID=MpyIVpCIsFSyqEdPID1O
   ```

3. **Data Exists** - Check Firebase Console:
   - Go to bowlingstatstracker project
   - Navigate to Firestore Database
   - Look for: `teams/MpyIVpCIsFSyqEdPID1O/players`

4. **Network Tab** - Check browser DevTools Network tab for Firestore API calls

## Field Name Mapping

The Stats app uses different field names than WHS Site. Here's the mapping:

| Stats App Field | WHS Site Field | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| `average` | `averageScore` | Player's bowling average |
| `highGame` | `highGame` | Highest single game score |
| `gamesPlayed` | `gamesPlayed` | Total games bowled |
| `name` | `name` | Player's full name |
| `grade` | `grade` | Current grade level |
| `isActive` | `isActive` | Whether player is on roster |
| `photoURL` | `photoURL` | Profile picture URL |

---

## Console Logging for Debugging

Each page logs helpful debug information:

```typescript
// Home.tsx
console.log(`✅ Home page: ${totalMembers} players, ${teamAverage} avg`);

// Roster.tsx
console.log(`✅ Loaded ${playersData.length} players from Stats app (Team: ${STATS_TEAM_ID})`);

// Stats.tsx
console.log(`✅ Loaded stats for ${activePlayers} players from Stats app (Team: ${STATS_TEAM_ID})`);
console.log(`   Team Average: ${teamAverage}, High Game: ${highGame}, Total Games: ${totalGamesPlayed}`);
```

Check your browser console to see these messages and verify data is loading.

## Security Notes

### Read-Only Access
The WHS Site has **READ-ONLY** access to Stats app data:
- Can query player stats
- Cannot modify player data
- Cannot delete records
- Cannot create new players

### Authentication
- Stats app and WHS Site have **separate authentication**
- Users sign in separately to each app
- No shared sessions between apps

### Firestore Rules
Stats app Firestore rules should allow public read for player stats:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId} {
      // Allow anyone to read player stats
      allow read: if true;

      // Only Stats app can write (verified via app check or auth)
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## What's Working Now

✅ **Home Page**
- Shows live team average from Stats app
- Shows actual number of active players
- Updates dynamically when players are added to Stats app

✅ **Roster Page**
- Displays all 14 bowlers from Stats app
- Shows real averages and high games
- Sorted by average score (highest first)
- Includes Mila Collins and all other players

✅ **Stats Page**
- Calculates team average from real data
- Shows high game across all players
- Displays total games played
- Top performers leaderboard with real stats

✅ **Build Process**
- TypeScript compiles successfully
- No errors or warnings
- Production build ready

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Season Wins and Championships
Currently hardcoded on Home page:
```typescript
seasonsWins: 15,  // TODO: Query from matches collection
championships: 3, // TODO: Query from tournaments collection
```

**To Fix:** Query these from Stats app collections once they're available.

### 2. Player Photos
Photos are stored in Stats app but may not all be uploaded yet.

**Fallback:** Shows default avatar (🎯) if no photo URL.

### 3. Offline Support
Currently requires internet connection to load stats.

**Future:** Could implement offline caching with IndexedDB.

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Real-Time Updates
Add Firestore real-time listeners instead of one-time queries:
```typescript
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(playersQuery, (snapshot) => {
  // Update state when data changes
});
```

### 2. Loading States
Add skeleton loaders while data fetches:
```typescript
{loading ? <SkeletonLoader /> : <PlayerCard />}
```

### 3. Error Handling
Show user-friendly error messages:
```typescript
{error && <ErrorMessage>Unable to load stats. Please try again.</ErrorMessage>}
```

### 4. Caching
Cache stats data to reduce Firebase reads:
```typescript
const cachedStats = localStorage.getItem('teamStats');
if (cachedStats && isFresh(cachedStats)) {
  return JSON.parse(cachedStats);
}
```
