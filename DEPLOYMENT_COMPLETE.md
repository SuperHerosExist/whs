## Next Steps

### 1. Create First Coach Account (REQUIRED)

You need to create the first coach account manually in Firebase Console:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/willard-tigers-bowling/authentication/users
2. Click "Add user"
3. Enter:
   - Email: (your coach email)
   - Password: (secure password)
4. Click "Add user"
5. Copy the User UID (it will look like: `abc123def456...`)
6. Go to Firestore Database: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/willard-tigers-bowling/firestore/databases/-default-/data
7. Create a new document in the `users` collection:
   - Document ID: (paste the User UID from step 5)
   - Fields:
     ```
     email: (coach email)
     displayName: (Coach's full name)
     role: "coach"
     programId: "willard-tigers"
     createdAt: (use "Timestamp" type, set to now)
     updatedAt: (use "Timestamp" type, set to now)
     ```

### 2. Test the Application

1. Visit: https://willard-tigers-bowling.web.app
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Use the coach credentials you created
4. Verify coach dashboard loads correctly
5. Try creating a test player profile
6. Test photo upload (should work up to 5MB)

### 3. Stats App Integration (Option 1 - Shared Firebase)

Once the WHS site is working:

1. Clone the Stats app from: https://github.com/SuperHerosExist/Stats.git
2. Configure it to use the same Firebase project: `willard-tigers-bowling`
3. Deploy Stats app to Firebase Hosting (different site or subdomain)
4. Update WHS `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_STATS_APP_URL=https://your-stats-app-url.web.app
   ```
5. Rebuild and redeploy WHS site: `npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting`

The Stats app will write to Firestore collections (games, sessions, frames), and the WHS site will read them (read-only access enforced by security rules).

### 4. Configure Authentication Providers (Optional)

To enable Google Sign-In:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/willard-tigers-bowling/authentication/providers
2. Click on "Google"
3. Enable it
4. Uncomment the Google Sign-In code in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

### 5. Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain (e.g., bowling.willardtigers.com):

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/willard-tigers-bowling/hosting/sites
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS setup instructions
4. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning (~24 hours)

## Troubleshooting

### If the site shows a blank page:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify Firebase configuration in browser's Network tab
4. Ensure Firestore indexes are built

### If login fails:
1. Verify email/password in Firebase Authentication console
2. Check that user document exists in Firestore `users` collection
3. Verify `role` field is set correctly
4. Check browser console for errors

### If player photo upload fails:
1. Verify file size is under 5MB
2. Check file type is an image (jpg/png/gif/svg/webp)
3. Ensure user is authenticated
4. Check Storage rules are deployed correctly

### If stats don't load:
1. Wait for Firestore indexes to finish building
2. Check that players collection has data
3. Verify security rules allow reading player data
4. Check browser console for errors
